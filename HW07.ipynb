    "When a categorical variable with 𝑘 categories is used in a regression model, it must be encoded into binary (indicator) variables. This is commonly done using dummy encoding, which creates a set of binary variables that represent each category of the original categorical variable. However, to avoid multicollinearity, 𝑘−1 binary variables are created, with one category serving as a **reference category.**\n",

    "**2. No Linear Trend:** Since all predictors are categorical and represented by indicator variables, the model does not imply any linear or continuous relationship. Instead, it accounts for categorical shifts between different levels of the non-binary factor.<br>\n",
    "**3. Interpretation Relative to Reference Category:** The intercept β0 represents the mean of 𝑦 for the reference category. Each coefficient βi (for 𝑖 = 1, ..., 𝑘−1) represents the difference in mean 𝑦 between the corresponding category and the reference category.\n",

    "1. **Simple vs. Multiple Linear Regression**: We discussed the difference between **Simple Linear Regression** (involving one continuous variable) and **Multiple Linear Regression** (involving multiple predictors, which can include continuous and categorical variables). In simple linear regression, there’s one predictor with a single slope and intercept, while multiple linear regression can include several predictors, allowing the model to capture more complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Continuous vs. Indicator Variables in Linear Models**: We reviewed the role of **continuous and indicator variables** in regression. A continuous variable represents a numeric input with a consistent impact on the output, while an indicator variable (binary or categorical) shifts the intercept, allowing the model to capture baseline differences across categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Effect of Adding a Single Indicator Variable**: When a single indicator variable is introduced with a continuous variable in multiple linear regression, the model gains the ability to represent different intercepts for each category (e.g., parallel lines for each group), while maintaining the same slope for the continuous predictor across both categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adding Interaction Between Continuous and Indicator Variables**: We covered how adding an **interaction term** between a continuous and an indicator variable allows for different slopes across categories, effectively capturing varying relationships between the continuous predictor and the dependent variable for each group. This adds flexibility by allowing the model to represent category-specific effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multiple Linear Regression with Only Indicator Variables from a Non-Binary Categorical Variable**: Finally, we explored models based entirely on indicator variables derived from a non-binary categorical variable. The resulting model form uses **dummy encoding** to create binary variables, allowing each category to have a distinct intercept (or mean value) relative to a reference category. This form captures mean differences between categories without implying any continuous relationship or trend."

    "\n",
    "3. **Plotting with Plotly**:\n",
    "   - You requested a Plotly visualization of the data with best-fit lines for both the additive and synergistic models.\n",
    "   - I provided a code example that creates separate plots showing best-fit lines for each model and explained how to interpret the visual differences. This approach shows whether the inclusion of interaction terms is necessary, based on whether slopes vary significantly between different predictor combinations."

    "1. **Low Variability Explained by the Model (Low $R^2$)** <br> The statement that \"the model only explains 17.6% of the variability in the data\" refers to the model's $R^2$, which measures the proportion of the variance in the outcome (in this case, `HP`) explained by the predictors. An $R^2$ of 17.6% is relatively low, meaning that while the predictors (`Sp. Def` and `Generation` and their interactions) do influence `HP`, there’s a substantial amount of variability in `HP` that the model does not capture. Other factors likely influence `HP`, leading to a lower $R^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Significant Coefficients (Evidence of Effect)** <br> - The fact that \"many of the coefficients are larger than 10 while having strong or very strong evidence against the null hypothesis of 'no effect'\" indicates these predictors have meaningful effects on `HP`, which can be statistically detected, but they don’t fully account for `HP`’s variability. <br> - Statistical significance is assessed by looking at p-values, which depend on the relationship strength between each predictor and the outcome. Low p-values here suggest that the effect of `Sp. Def`, `Generation`, or their interaction on `HP` is unlikely to be due to random chance, even if these factors collectively don't explain much of HP’s total variance."

    "The model shows a low $R^2$, explaining only 17.6% of the variability in HP, meaning many factors influencing HP are unaccounted for. However, some predictors (Sp. Def, Generation, and their interaction) have significant coefficients, indicating they do have a meaningful impact on HP despite not explaining much of its total variance. Thus, significant effects can exist even when the overall model explains only a small portion of the outcome variability."

    "The `model4_linear_form` creates new predictor variables through interaction between features like `Attack`, `Defense`, `Speed`, `Legendary`, `Sp. Def`, and `Sp. Atk`. These interaction terms leads to multicollinearity because many of the interaction in the design matrix (`model4_spec.exog`) are highly correlated. This resulted in a highly unstable model that may perform well in-sample but poorly out-of-sample, which explains why `model4_fit` has poor out-of-sample $R^2$ values. In other words, the model overfits the training data but failed to generalize to new data, as it memorizes the data rather than capturing a robust relationship."

    "### Development of `model5_linear_form`\n",
    "In `model3_linear_form`, we only starts by using simple linear regression and applying `Attack` and `Defense` as predictors to see if these variables can predict `HP`. In `model4_linear_form`, we incorporated interaction terms between `Attack`, `Defense`, `Speed`, `Legendary`, `Sp. Def`, and `Sp. Atk` to capture more complex relationships among multiple variables. Derived from these 2 models, we add categorical variables in `model5_linear_form`, which are `Generation`, `Type 1`, and `Type 2`. We do this in order to obtain information on types and generations to capture characttiristics potentially affecting `HP` that may be missed by previously introduced variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development of `model6_linear_form`\n",
    "In `model6_linear_form`, we look at the variables `Attack`, `Speed`, `Sp. Def`, and `Sp. Atk` and we simplified the previous model by only looking at specific values from the categorical variables, which are `Water` and `Normal` in `Type 1` and `Generation 2` and `Generation 5` in `Generation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development of `model7_linear_form`\n",
    "In `model7_linear_form`, rather than looking individually between each variable as in `model6_linear_form`, we reintroduced the interaction terms between `Attack`, `Speed`, `Sp. Def`, and `Sp. Atk`."

    "#### Result\n",
    "The **in-sample $R^2$** values tend t ocluster high, meaning that the variance in target data is explained well when fitting the model. However, the range of values suggests some instability in the fit, which can be due to interactions and complex relationships in the model. Meanwhile, the **out-of-sample $R^2$** has a wider spread, indicating that the model performance varies significantly when tested on the unseen data. Lower **out-of-sample $R^2$** values indicate that the model's predictive power on new data is not as reliable as on training data. This circumstance may arises due to inherent randomness in sampling that usually occurs in small or noisy dataset.\n",

    "#### Purpose of this demonstration\n",
    "This demonstration shows how the model’s performance can vary across different splits of the data, especially for complex models like `model7_linear_form_CS` with interaction terms, illustrating that while a model might perform well on the training set, this performance does not always hold for unseen data."

    "3. **Applying the Approach to `model7_linear_form_CS`**: You wanted to apply the approach to a specific model (`model7_linear_form_CS`), which we visualized in Plotly, showing how the model performs across different samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comment on Overfitting and Unexpected Out-of-Sample Performance**: You shared a comment about overfitting and an example where out-of-sample R-squared was unexpectedly higher than in-sample R-squared. I explained why this isn't necessarily underfitting and might be due to sampling variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Illustrating Different Models on Pokémon Data**: You showed code that fits models to Pokémon data subsets based on \"Generation.\" The models' in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values are compared across generations. I explained that this illustrates how well the models generalize and highlighted the concepts of domain shift and model validity.\n",
